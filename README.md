## Description
The goal of this application is to create a functioning blog which stores users data locally and displays all previous blog posts with each unique username, title, and content. The newest blog posts will show up at the top of the page. When the user clicks on the back button they are redirected to the home page where they can make another post. There is also a checkbox that when checked or unchecked changes the styling of the page. It turns on darkmode or disables it. Darkmod will maintain it's current state even through going back and forth between the home page and the blog page. The only minor issue I have yet to solve is mainting the state of the checkbox itself, it may be confusing for the user when they disable dark mode in the blog page and when returning to the home page the box remains checked. Other than that the application works as expected and stores all the blog posts in local storage.
